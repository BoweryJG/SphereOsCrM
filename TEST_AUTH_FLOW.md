# Test Auth Flow - Central Auth with Module Return

## What I've Fixed:

1. **Auth Context** now stores the current path before OAuth redirect
2. **AuthCallback** component reads the stored path and returns you there
3. **OAuth redirect** goes to `/auth/callback` instead of root

## How It Works:

1. User visits `/canvas` (or any module page)
2. If not authenticated, gets redirected to `/login`
3. The original path (`/canvas`) is stored in localStorage
4. User clicks OAuth login
5. After successful auth, callback handler returns them to `/canvas`

## Test Steps:

### 1. Clear Everything
```javascript
// Run in browser console
localStorage.clear();
```

### 2. Start the App
```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Test Different Entry Points

#### Test A: Canvas Module
1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/canvas`
2. Should redirect to login
3. Click Google/Facebook login
4. After auth, should return to `/canvas`

#### Test B: Market Data Module  
1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/market`
2. Should redirect to login
3. Click Google/Facebook login
4. After auth, should return to `/market`

#### Test C: Direct Login
1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Click Google/Facebook login
3. After auth, should go to `/` (default)

## Console Messages to Watch:

- "OAuth sign in - redirect URL: http://localhost:3000/auth/callback"
- "Will return to: /canvas" (or whatever path you started from)
- "Auth callback - Returning to: /canvas"
- "Auth state changed: SIGNED_IN [email]"

## Module Structure:

Your app should support these modules:
- **CRM**: `/` (default dashboard)
- **Canvas**: `/canvas/*` 
- **Market Data**: `/market/*`

Each module can check auth and users stay in their module after login.
